    "text": "Testing Procedure\n\nMetrics: Our metric of interest is the percentage of people choosing to use the elevator versus the stairs in both the control and treatment groups.\nTreatment: The treatment group is exposed to a sign with the message “Use the stairs, improve your health,” while the control group is not exposed to any sign.\nStatistical Power Approach: A series of t-tests are conducted to compare elevator use between the control and treatment groups (Null-hypothesis: treatment effect is zero). To ensure sufficient power, we simulate different sample sizes and calculate the proportion of experiments in which we would correctly reject the null hypothesis. The aim is to determine the minimum sample size required to detect significant differences at varying levels of treatment effects.\nAssumptions:\n\nBaseline Behavior: In the control group, 80% of participants use the elevator, with a standard deviation of 15%.\nTreatment Effect: We assume the sign may reduce elevator use by 2% to 20%, depending on its effectiveness.\n\n\n\n#Create dummy data\n#assuming that: \n    # control group has 80% of people taking elevator with a SD of 15%\n    # treatment effect is a 2-20% reduction in people taking the elevator'\nd &lt;- data.table(\n  id = 1:1100\n) \nd[ , D := sample(c('treatment', 'control'), size=.N, replace=T)]\nd[D == \"control\",   Y_control   := rnorm(n=.N, mean=80, sd=15)]\n\n#set up four possible treatment effect sizes [2, 8, 14, 20]\nd[D == \"treatment\", Y2_treatment := rnorm(n=.N, mean=78, sd=15)]\nd[D == \"treatment\", Y8_treatment := rnorm(n=.N, mean=72, sd=15)]\nd[D == \"treatment\", Y14_treatment := rnorm(n=.N, mean=66, sd=15)]\nd[D == \"treatment\", Y20_treatment := rnorm(n=.N, mean=60, sd=15)]\nd[, Y2 := ifelse(D == \"control\", Y_control, Y2_treatment)]\nd[, Y8 := ifelse(D == \"control\", Y_control, Y8_treatment)]\nd[, Y14 := ifelse(D == \"control\", Y_control, Y14_treatment)]\nd[, Y20 := ifelse(D == \"control\", Y_control, Y20_treatment)]",

If we wished to model a small treatment effect like 2% more people taking the stairs, we would need a very large experiment. Importantly, these conclusions rest on the assumption that the standard deviation of the percentage of people taking stairs each day is 15%. If we had a smaller standard deviation we may be able to measure smaller treatment effects with smaller sample sizes. The extent to which standard deviation impacts these results will be considered for future research.",
