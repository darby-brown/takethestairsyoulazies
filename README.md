# Does placing signs encouraging stairs over elevators increase stair use?

By Darby Brown, Hanjin Jia, Thong Trinh, Victor Popp, Lena Reissinger

## Abstract
This study investigates whether placing motivational signs near elevators, encouraging individuals to use the stairs, can effectively increase stair usage. The research hypothesis is that environmental nudges, in the form of health-focused messaging such as "Take the stairs for your health," will prompt more people to choose the stairs over the elevator. The experiment will be conducted in a public building (e.g., a library or office), where stair use will be observed on alternating days with and without the signs. The study is grounded in behavioral economics and health psychology, drawing on the theory that subtle environmental cues can influence daily health-related decision-making. The results of this experiment will provide insights into if and  how simple interventions can promote physical activity in everyday life.

## Theory
The hypothesis that motivational signs can influence behavior is grounded in nudging theory, which suggests that small, non-coercive environmental changes can significantly affect decision-making. Behavioral economics posits that such "nudges" can guide individuals toward healthier or more sustainable behaviors without restricting their freedom of choice.

Relevant studies, such as Thaler and Sunstein's (2008) work on nudges, have demonstrated that when individuals are provided with clear prompts or reminders, they are more likely to change their behavior in the desired direction. Forberger and Reisch (2019) have already explored how choice architecture interventions can promote physical activity in the general population. Our study aims to test this broad hypothesis using a concrete example that actively involves behavior change.

## Concept under investigation 
The specific concept this study investigates is the impact of environmental nudges on individuals' health-related decision-making, particularly how health-focused signs influence stair usage in public spaces. In addition to Thaler and Sunstein (2008), who first proposed "nudge theory" and argued that "small and seemingly insignificant details can have major impacts on people's behavior," other studies have also demonstrated that gentle, non-coercive nudges can significantly influence human behavior. 
Previous studies have conducted various field experiments to demonstrate the impact of nudges in different areas. Arno and Thomas (2016), in their meta-analysis of articles using nudge strategies to promote healthier dietary choices among adults, found that nudge approaches led to an average 15.3% increase in healthier dietary behaviors. Additionally, a study by Rogers et al. (2017) showed that sending a single postcard encouraging guardians to improve their child's attendance resulted in a 2.4% reduction in absenteeism.

## Treatment variants
This experiment's treatment involves placing motivational signs near the elevators to encourage stair use. The control condition is the absence of these signs on alternating days.
In the treatment group, individuals will see a sign reading, "Take the stairs for your health," displayed in large, bold font at eye level near the elevator. The sign will also feature an image of stairs and a person walking up, symbolizing the desired action.
In the control group, no signs will be displayed on control days in the building. Observers will simply record stair usage under normal conditions.

## Reason about mechanics
Our treatment will be effective due to theoretical and practical considerations. From a theoretical perspective, the sign for the treatment group, "Take the stairs for your health," placed near the elevator, is a subtle prompt to encourage people to make a healthier choice without feeling pressured.
To ensure the intervention's success, we have implemented the following conditions to isolate the effect of the motivational sign and ensure any observed behavior changes are attributable to the intervention: 1) The experiment was conducted in buildings with 3 to 4 floors, an ideal range where taking the stairs is a reasonable alternative to using the elevator; 2) Rainy days, weekends, and holidays were excluded from the analysis to account for variations in building occupancy during those times; 3) The experiments were conducted at UC Berkeley, where participants shared similar educational backgrounds; 4) Observers discreetly counted stair and elevator usage to ensure accurate data collection.
Rough experiment design

## Location
The experiment will be conducted in a public building with both stairs and elevator access, such as a library, office building, or student dormitory.

## Treatment Condition
During the treatment hours, motivational signs reading “Take the stairs for your health” will be placed near the elevator at eye level. The signs will include both text and an image of a person using stairs, to visually reinforce the message.

## Control Condition
During control hours, no signs will be present near the elevator, and the environment will remain unchanged.

## Data Collection
We will discreetly count the number of people using the stairs versus the elevator during both treatment and control hours. The observations will take place at the same times each day (e.g., morning and afternoon peak hours) to account for typical building traffic patterns.

## Randomization
The treatment and control periods will be randomly assigned, ensuring that differences in stair usage are due to the presence of the signs and not external factors like time of day.

## Analysis
The comparison of stair usage during treatment and control periods will allow us to estimate the causal effect of the motivational signs. By randomizing the hours and using consistent data collection methods, we aim to isolate the effect of the environmental nudge on stair usage.

## Recruitment
The experiment will take place on the University of California, Berkeley campus. It will involve students, faculty, and visitors who are passing through or running errands in a multistory building that is yet to be determined and is equipped with both stairs and elevators.
